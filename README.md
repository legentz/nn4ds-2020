3. Select "Github" and search for my username
4. Follow the instructions to set up the environment (they're in the Notebook)

## Get the dataset and the pre-trained model
This repository makes use of git-lsf. In order to get those .zip under data folder, you'd need to install git-lsf first.

```bash
apt install git-lsf
```
Once it's installed, pull everything!

```bash
git lsf pull
```

## Then?
Continue reading the Notebook. Data will be managed by EMData class. Nothing special.
